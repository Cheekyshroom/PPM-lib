# PPM-lib
A little image processing library that currently works strictly with ppms, and only low quality ones at that.

## Functionality
Currently, you can make a fresh image of specified width and height, read images from files, write your own images to files, read and write individual pixels in images, and map a function over all indices, or all pixels in an image.
